## Experience 
### Data Scientist Intern @[DIHI](https://dihi.org/)

**Evaluation for Real-time Inpatient Models** 
- To evaluate the performance of a sepsis prediction model(using time-series EHR data) that was running at Duke Hospital in real time to support clinical decisions
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis and researched on evaluation metrics for time-series models
- Designed and implemented custom confusion matrix, encounter plot, time-dependent ROC plot, time difference plot and AMOC curve in python (NumPy, Pandas, time, Scikit learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
- Successfully improved performance evaluation and clinical interpretation on an independent dataset

## Projects


**Data Science**

### Zero-shot image style transfer [link](https://github.com/NicolasHu11/Zero-Shot-Image-Style-Transfer)
- To change an image’s style using another arbitrary image with high efficiency and good visual quality
- Researched on related work including feed-forward neural networks and optimization methods in real time
- Proposed a new loss function for training which is more efficient and easier to implement and comprehend
- Results on CelebA dataset showed our method achieved higher efficiency with comparable visual quality
than perceptual loss and avatar-net (PyTorch, Pillow, TensorFlow)

### Detecting Autism Spectrum Disorder(ASD) in adults and children [link](https://github.com/NicolasHu11/ASD-Detection)
- To help with the diagnosis of ASD using ASD screening questionnaire and compare classifiers’ performances
- Preprocessed raw data into model matrix and explored data using PCA, t-SNE and correlation heatmap
- Implemented and compared five models(Regression, SVM, kNN, Naïve Bayes) with ROC curve, Precision Recall curve and feature importance to find the best model, which achieved 100% accuracy and F1 score (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit learn, Matplotlib)

### Short/Long term mortality prediction [link](https://github.com/NicolasHu11/Short-Long-Term-Mortality-Prediction)
- To predict 30-day and 1-year mortality for ICU patients in hospital
- Built a PostgreSQL database using MIMIC-III dataset and constructed design matrix, custom features, and labels after data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and literature review
- Predicted mortality risk score using two convolutional neural network models for comparison and evaluated using ROC and Precision-Recall curve (SQL, Psycopg2, Pandas, Datetime, Scikit learn, TensorFlow, Seaborn)
- Outperformed other risk scores such as SAPS II, OASIS, LODS etc. with AUC of 0.962 and AP of 0.883   

**Software Development**

### Duke Master Program iOS app [link](https://github.com/NicolasHu11/Duke-Masters-iOS-app)
- Implemented Shibboleth Authentication for Duke NetID with Face ID support and extracted data from multiple duke websites by calling APIs and processing texts (Swift 5)
- Stored user and messages data on Firebase and displayed events on calendar view
- Acted as communication liaison with sponsor and team manager


### Image Server for Storage and Processing [link](https://github.com/NicolasHu11/BME547Final)

- Developed APIs on a Flask server with GUI as front-end and designed database structures on MongoDB
- Integrated GUI, server and database and performed unit testing (pytest, Travis CI)

### Arduino-Android sleep monitor [link](https://github.com/NicolasHu11/Arduino-Sleep-Monitor)
- Designed and prototyped a wearable wrist band with Arduino hardware modules for physiological signal
collection; sensors: heart rate, temperature, and gyroscope/accelerometer
- Implemented and tested an Android app for real time data transmission and display via Bluetooth, data
storage(SQLite), signal processing and sleep analysis (Arduino, Java)
